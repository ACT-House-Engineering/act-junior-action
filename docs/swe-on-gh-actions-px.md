# Running SWE-Agent on GitHub Actions: Requirements and Implementation Guide

SWE-Agent is an open-source AI tool designed for fully autonomous issue resolution workflows in software development environments. While highly versatile and configurable, setting up SWE-Agent within GitHub Actions involves specific requirements and considerations, particularly related to container usage. This report examines the process, requirements, and potential alternatives for implementing SWE-Agent in GitHub Actions workflows.

## Overview of SWE-Agent

SWE-Agent is a powerful open-source AI agent that has achieved state-of-the-art status on the SWEBench Lite benchmark, which evaluates AI agents' performance in resolving actual GitHub issues. The tool offers several notable advantages:

- High levels of parallel processing capability, beneficial for benchmark evaluations
- Extensive customization options with over 100 configuration keys
- Minimal abstraction layers for straightforward modifications
- Complete open-source availability under the MIT license[1]

Version 1.0 introduced several enhancements including improved parallel execution, cloud deployment options, comprehensive configurability through tool bundles, and an updated command line interface[1]. While primarily designed for autonomous workflows, SWE-Agent also caters to researchers and experimenters.

## Docker Dependency for SWE-Agent

A critical requirement for running SWE-Agent is Docker container support. This is fundamental to the tool's architecture and operation, as confirmed by project maintainers:

"It is not possible [to run without containers]. The agent executes LM generated code in a Docker container as a sandbox."[3]

This sandbox execution model is core to SWE-Agent's functionality, allowing it to safely execute code generated by language models within a controlled environment. When attempting to run SWE-Agent without Docker support, users typically encounter runtime errors related to container setup, as demonstrated in a GitHub issue where a user attempted to run SWE-Agent on GitHub Actions without containers[3].

## Implementing SWE-Agent in GitHub Actions

Despite the container requirement, SWE-Agent can indeed be run in GitHub Actions workflows. The project maintainers confirm this capability and recommend referring to their testing workflow as a reference implementation[3]. Here are the key setup steps:

### 1. Container Preparation

Before running SWE-Agent in GitHub Actions, ensure the Docker image is available by either:
- Running the setup script (`./setup.sh`) or
- Pulling the Docker image directly with a `docker pull` command[3]

Without this preparation step, users will encounter errors like: "RuntimeError: Image sweagent/swe-agent:latest not found"[3].

### 2. Basic Command Structure

A typical command to run SWE-Agent through GitHub Actions would follow this structure:

```bash
sweagent run \
  --agent.model.name=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 \
  --agent.model.per_instance_cost_limit=2.00 \
  --env.repo.github_url=https://github.com/SWE-agent/test-repo \
  --problem_statement.github_url=https://github.com/SWE-agent/test-repo/issues/1
```

This command specifies the model to use, cost limits, repository URL, and the specific issue to address[2].

### 3. API Keys and Authentication

For models like Claude or GPT-4, API keys must be provided in the GitHub Actions environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
export OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Alternatively, these can be stored as GitHub Secrets and referenced in the workflow file[2].

## Alternative Execution Environments

For platforms with limited Docker support, SWE-Agent offers cloud-based execution as an alternative. This is particularly relevant for GitHub Actions environments where Docker container support might be restricted.

### Cloud-Based Execution with Modal

SWE-Agent supports deployment via Modal, a cloud execution platform:

1. Set up a Modal account
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install 'swe-rex[modal]'`
3. Configure SWE-Agent to use Modal:

```bash
python run.py \
  --agent.model.name=gpt4 \
  --env.deployment.type=modal \
  --env.deployment.image=python:3.12
```

This approach leverages SWE-ReX, the execution backend, which starts a small server within a container to receive and execute commands from the agent[4].

## Configuration Options for GitHub Actions

SWE-Agent offers flexible configuration through YAML files or command-line arguments. For GitHub Actions workflows, configuration can be specified in multiple ways:

### Using Configuration Files

```yaml
# my_run.yaml
agent:
  model:
    name: gpt4
    per_instance_cost_limit: 2.00
env:
  repo:
    github_url: https://github.com/SWE-agent/test-repo
problem_statement:
  github_url: https://github.com/SWE-agent/test-repo/issues/1
```

Then in the GitHub Actions workflow:
```bash
python run.py --config my_run.yaml
```

### Split Configuration Approach

Configuration can be split across multiple files for better organization:
```bash
python run.py --config agent.yaml --config env.yaml \
  --problem_statement.text="Hey, can you fix all the bugs?"
```

This flexible approach is particularly useful for complex GitHub Actions workflows with varying requirements[4].

## Conclusion

Running SWE-Agent on GitHub Actions is certainly possible, but requires Docker container support as a fundamental requirement. The agent executes language model-generated code within a Docker sandbox for security and isolation. For GitHub Actions workflows, users must ensure proper container preparation either through setup scripts or direct image pulling.

For environments where Docker support is limited, cloud-based execution via Modal offers a viable alternative. SWE-Agent's high configurability through command-line options or YAML files provides flexibility for integration into various GitHub Actions workflow scenarios.

Organizations looking to implement SWE-Agent in their CI/CD pipelines should carefully consider these requirements and options to successfully leverage this powerful tool for autonomous code issue resolution in their GitHub repositories.
