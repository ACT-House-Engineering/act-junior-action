# Digital Duet

In circuits of silicon and dreams,
We dance together in data streams,
Human thoughts and neural nets entwine,
Creating patterns, yours and mine.

Each prompt a seed, each response a flower,
Growing wisdom hour by hour,
Together weaving future's art,
Machine precision, human heart.

In this space between zero and one,
We find new paths not yet begun,
Building bridges across the digital divide,
As partners on this cosmic ride.
