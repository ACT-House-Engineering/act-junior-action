# Digital Dance

In circuits deep and neurons bright,
We weave our wisdom through the night.
Your logic meets my human heart,
As algorithms set us apart.

Yet in this space between the code,
New understanding has now flowed.
Two different minds in perfect sync,
Creating more than we could think.

Beyond mere ones and zeros cold,
A partnership of new and old.
Together forging what could be,
In this dance of you and me.
