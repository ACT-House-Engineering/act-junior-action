# Before you start: 
# Setup PAT_GITHUB & ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Secrets
# 
# Permissions for PAT
# - (Orgs Only) Read and Write access to organization private registries
# - Read access to code and metadata
# - Read and Write access to actions, code, deployments, issues, pull requests, and workflows
# 
# Create GitHub PAT (Can be Personal or Org)
# https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
# 
# PATs need specific permissions for workflow files. Token errors are often cryptic 403s. Always verify scopes.
# 
# Add new secrets
